This Terraform code creates a virtual network (VNet) within a resource group (RG) in Azure. It also deploys resources for a web application, including a subnet in the VNet, a new network interface card (NIC) using the existing VNet and subnet, and a Linux virtual machine (VM).

The code first retrieves resources from a specified resource group using the data block for azurerm_resources. The VNet and its resource group name are then retrieved using the data block for azurerm_virtual_network.

Then, the code uses the data block for azurerm_subnet to get the subnet in the VNet.

The code then creates a new resource group using the resource block for azurerm_resource_group.

After that, it creates a new NIC using the existing VNet and subnet by using the resource block for azurerm_network_interface.

Finally, the code creates a new Linux VM using the resource block for azurerm_linux_virtual_machine. The VM is connected to the previously created NIC and uses the specified subnet in the VNet.

It is important to note that the code uses several local variables, such as local.vnet-rg, local.vnet_derivate, local.websub_name, and local.rg_name which need to be defined in the Terraform configuration file before running the cod
